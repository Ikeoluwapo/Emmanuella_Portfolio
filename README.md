# [Python Projects]
## [Project 1: Electronics](https://github.com/Ikeoluwapo/Electronics)
The aim of this project is to collect, clean, process, analyze, visualize and report trends from the Electronic shop data using Python.

### Dataset Overview
Name: Electronics

Format: CSV (Comma Separated Values). Gotten via link

Columns: [item_id,	user_id,	rating,	timestamp,	model_attr,	category,	brand	year,	user_attr	split]

Size: [83,237,424 bytes]
This shows my growth journey in SQL. How I used mySQL for analyzing then excel

## [Project 2: Covid-19](https://github.com/Ikeoluwapo/Covid-19)
The aim of this project was to collect, clean, process, analyze, visualize and report trends from the Covid-19 data using Python.

The data used was gotten from the covid 19 site not a csv file.

### Dataset Overview
Name: covid 19

Format: website link

Columns: [iso_code,	continent	location,	date,	total_cases,	new_cases,	new_cases_smoothed,	total_deaths,	new_deaths,	new_deaths_smoothed,	...	male_smokers,	handwashing_facilities,	excess_mortality_cumulative_absolute,	excess_mortality_cumulative,	excess_mortality,	excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million] 67 columns in total
