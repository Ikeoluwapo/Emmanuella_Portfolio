# [mySQL Project](https://github.com/Ikeoluwapo/MySQL-Journey-)
This shows my growth journey in SQL. How I used mySQL for analyzing then excel and flourish for visualization.

The sql-murder-mystery project was my first major work. I used the **SQL Online IDE** for the murder project. I got to use the various joins- left join, right join, outer join, union and union all. This project was used to track the killer in a murder case based on the information and descriptions giving by eye-witnesses.
